## Introduction

In today's digital age, effective communication is essential for fostering inclusivity and breaking down barriers. However, for individuals who rely on visual communication methods like American Sign Language (ASL), traditional communication tools often fall short. This is where the GenAI-powered Global Sign Language Translator comes in.

Our innovative solution leverages the power of Gemini 2.0 Flash AI to convert multilingual text and speech into expressive American Sign Language videos within seconds. By bridging the gap between spoken and written language and sign language, we're not just creating a technological solution—we're fostering a more inclusive world where communication barriers no longer create gaps between people.

Sign language is not merely a communication tool but an essential part of deaf culture and identity. Through modern technology, we aim to provide a convenient tool for the general public to communicate easily with the deaf community, promoting social inclusion and enhancing understanding of deaf culture.

## Solution Overview

The GenAI-powered Global Sign Language Translator is a modern web application that accepts multiple types of input—multilingual text, voice recording, and audio file upload—and returns an AI-generated American Sign Language video within 5 seconds. The system supports various features designed to enhance the learning experience, including adjustable playback speeds (0.1x-1x) and loop playback functionality.

At its core, our solution is built around a robust processing pipeline that leverages state-of-the-art AI models and cloud services:

1. **Input Processing**: The system accepts text input directly or converts audio to text using the Whisper API.

2. **AI-Powered Translation**: Gemini 2.0 Flash AI converts the text into ASL gloss notation, which represents the grammatical structure of sign language.

3. **Video Generation**: The system maps the gloss notation to pre-generated video clips and assembles them into a seamless ASL video.

4. **Performance Optimization**: A sophisticated caching mechanism ensures fast response times for repeated translations.

All of this is orchestrated through Google Cloud Platform services, providing a scalable, reliable, and secure solution that can be accessed from any device with a web browser.

## Architecture Details

![System Architecture](architecture2.png)

Our system architecture is built on Google Cloud Platform and follows a numbered workflow as illustrated in the diagram:

**1. Generate ASL Dataset:**
Cloud Storage stores video datasets processed by Compute Engine running ComfyUI, creating the foundation for sign language videos. This batch process currently includes around 2,200 videos using advanced pose estimation techniques, ensuring a comprehensive library of sign language expressions.

**2. Frontend (Firebase):**
HTML/CSS/JavaScript application hosted on Firebase App Hosting, providing the user interface for interaction. Built with React.js and Tailwind CSS, the frontend offers a responsive design that works seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices.

**3. Firebase Authentication:**
Secures user access through anonymous authentication, maintaining privacy while enabling personalized experiences. This allows users to access the service without creating accounts while still providing a secure environment.

**4. Token Exchange:**
Cloud Functions handle the conversion between Firebase tokens and GCP tokens, ensuring secure API access. This critical security layer prevents unauthorized access to the translation services and user data.

**5. Chrome + WebAI:**
Browser-based interface where users interact with the application through text input or audio recording. The interface is designed to be intuitive and accessible, with clear visual feedback during the translation process.

**6. Whisper API:**
Transcribes audio input to text, enabling voice-based interaction with the system. This powerful speech recognition service handles various accents, speech patterns, and background noise conditions.

**7. ASL Translation Workflow:**
Core processing pipeline that:
- Checks sentence cache in Firestore
- Translates non-English text to English using Cloud Translation API
- Creates ASL gloss using Vertex AI (Gemini 2.0 Flash)
- Matches ASL video segments from the database
- Updates the sentence cache for future use
- Outputs the final ASL video

**8. Workflow Connection:**
Secure connection between the frontend and backend workflow, passing authenticated requests for processing. This ensures that all communication between components is encrypted and verified.

This architecture enables seamless translation from text or speech to sign language videos, with performance optimization through caching and cloud-based processing. The modular design allows for easy scaling and future enhancements.

## Technical Implementation

### Core Technologies

Our solution leverages several cutting-edge technologies:

- **Frontend**: React.js with Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- **Cloud Platform**: Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- **AI Models**:
  - Gemini 2.0 Flash for ASL generation
  - Whisper API for speech recognition
- **Storage Solutions**:
  - Firestore for structured data
  - Cloud Storage for video files
- **Processing Tools**:
  - Cloud Translation API
  - ComfyUI for video processing
  - Cloud Functions for authentication

### AI Model Application

The Gemini 2.0 Flash AI model is the heart of our translation system. It converts English text into ASL gloss notation through a sophisticated process:

1. **Natural Language Understanding**: The model analyzes the semantic structure and context of the input text, understanding the meaning beyond just the words.

2. **Sign Language Generation**: It then decomposes the text into basic units, maps them to sign symbols, and optimizes the grammar structure according to ASL rules. This involves:
   - Removing unnecessary articles and prepositions
   - Converting to ALL CAPS format
   - Preserving nouns, verbs, adjectives, and conjunctions
   - Maintaining original word order
   - Ensuring proper spacing between words

3. **Quality Enhancement**: The output undergoes context-aware refinement to ensure natural expression, cultural adaptation, and expression accuracy.

The prompt used for Gemini AI includes specific rules:
```
Convert to ASL gloss notation using only words from our dataset. Rules:

1. ALL CAPS for ALL words
2. Topic-Comment structure: Place topic first, then comment (e.g., "STORE I GO" not "I GO STORE")
3. Keep: nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, numbers, pronouns, AND/OR/BUT/IF/BECAUSE
4. Remove: a/an/the, be verbs (am/is/are/was/were), most prepositions
5. Time markers at beginning: YESTERDAY, TOMORROW, MORNING, AFTERNOON, NIGHT, NEXT_WEEK, FINISH
6. For questions: use question words (WHAT, WHERE, WHO, WHY, HOW) in original position
7. Negation: Use NOT after the verb (e.g., "I don't like" becomes "I LIKE NOT")
8. For continuous actions: Repeat word (e.g., "walking continuously" becomes "WALK WALK")
9. Geographic locations: Use exact country/city names from dataset (e.g., AMERICA, CHINA, NEW_YORK, HONG_KONG)
10. NO punctuation marks of any kind
11. Use space between words

Examples:
- "I am going to the store tomorrow" → "TOMORROW STORE I GO"
- "Do you want coffee or tea?" → "YOU WANT COFFEE OR TEA"
- "She doesn't understand the question" → "SHE UNDERSTAND NOT QUESTION"
- "The man in the blue shirt is my brother" → "MAN BLUE SHIRT BROTHER"
- "I have been waiting for a long time" → "I WAIT WAIT LONG TIME"
- "I want to visit New York next year" → "NEXT_YEAR I WANT VISIT NEW_YORK"

Return ONLY gloss words in a single line without any punctuation, extra spaces or newlines. Use ONLY words from our ASL dataset.
```

### Video Generation Process

Once the ASL gloss notation is generated, our video mapping algorithm:

1. **Symbol Analysis**: Parses the sign language symbol sequence, identifies compound expressions, and determines temporal relationships.

2. **Video Matching**: Matches each symbol with standard sign videos from our database, combining them for complex expressions and optimizing transitions for a natural flow.

3. **Performance Optimization**: Implements local caching of frequent segments, context-based preloading, and streaming optimization to ensure smooth playback.

### ASL Translation Workflow

Our core processing pipeline executes the translation process through a series of precisely defined steps. The following breakdown illustrates the flow based on different caching scenarios:

#### Scenario 1: Cache Miss

When the system processes a sentence for the first time or cannot find a corresponding record in the cache, it executes the following full workflow. We use the Chinese input "我想買咖啡" as an example; this flow also applies to English input (which would simply skip the translation step).

1.  **Receive Input**: The workflow receives the text input provided by the user.
    ```json
    // Example: Chinese Input
    {
      "jsonPayload": {
        "start": {
          "argument": {
            "text": "我想買咖啡"
          }
        }
      },
      "timestamp": "2025-03-29T18:00:45.032787353Z"
    }
    ```

2.  **Cache Check (Miss)**: The system uses the original input text "我想買咖啡" to look up in the `sentence_cache` collection but finds no record.
    ```json
    // Example: Cache Miss for Chinese Input (Error message parsed)
    {
      "textPayload": {
        "message_prefix": "Cache check error: ",
        "error_details": {
          "body": {
            "error": {
              "code": 404,
              "message": "Document \"projects/genasl/databases/(default)/documents/sentence_cache/我想買咖啡\" not found.",
              "status": "NOT_FOUND"
            }
          }
        }
      },
      "timestamp": "2025-03-29T18:00:45.843691192Z"
    }
    ```

3.  **Language Detection**: The system detects the input language as Traditional Chinese.
    ```json
    // Example: Detected Traditional Chinese (Plain text, no formatting needed)
    {
      "textPayload": "zh-TW",
      "timestamp": "2025-03-29T18:00:46.362543476Z"
    }
    ```

4.  **Intermediate Translation (Conditional)**: Since the detected language is not English, the system translates it into English.
    ```json
    // Example: Chinese input translated to English (Plain text, no formatting needed)
    {
      "textPayload": "I want to buy coffee", // "我想買咖啡" -> "I want to buy coffee"
      "timestamp": "2025-03-29T18:00:46.904554817Z"
    }
    ```

5.  **ASL Gloss Conversion**: The system passes the translated English text to the Gemini 2.0 Flash model to obtain the full API response containing the ASL Gloss sequence.
    ```json
    // Example: Gemini API Response (from Chinese input workflow)
    {
      "textPayload": {
        "body": {
          "candidates": [
            {
              "content": {
                "parts": [
                  {
                    // System extracts Gloss text from here
                    "text": "I WANT BUY COFFEE\n"
                  }
                ],
                "role": "model"
              },
              "finishReason": "STOP",
              "avgLogprobs": -0.000014902092516422272
            }
          ],
          "usageMetadata": {
            "promptTokenCount": 384,
            "candidatesTokenCount": 5,
            "totalTokenCount": 389
            // ... other metadata ...
          }
          // ... other response metadata ...
        },
        "code": 200,
        "headers": { /* ... Headers ... */ }
      },
      "timestamp": "2025-03-29T18:00:47.551136861Z"
    }
    // The system then extracts the Gloss: "I WANT BUY COFFEE"
    ```

6.  **Video URL Mapping**: The system iterates through each word in the extracted Gloss sequence ("I WANT BUY COFFEE") and looks up the corresponding video URL in the `asl_mappings2` collection.
    ```json
    // Example: Looking up video URL for Gloss "I"
    {
      "textPayload": {
        "createTime": "2025-03-25T19:51:19.599373Z",
        "fields": {
          "gloss": { "stringValue": "I" },
          "video_url": { "stringValue": "https://storage.googleapis.com/genasl-video-files/I.mp4" }
        },
        "name": "projects/genasl/databases/(default)/documents/asl_mappings2/I",
        "updateTime": "2025-03-25T19:51:19.599373Z"
      },
      "timestamp": "2025-03-29T18:00:48.196208948Z"
    }
    // Example: Looking up video URL for Gloss "WANT" (similar format)
    // ...
    // Example: Looking up video URL for Gloss "BUY" (similar format)
    // ...
    // Example: Looking up video URL for Gloss "COFFEE" (similar format)
    // ...
    ```

7.  **Cache Storage**: The system stores the **original input text ("我想買咖啡")**, the generated ASL Gloss ("I WANT BUY COFFEE"), and the retrieved list of video URLs together in the `sentence_cache` collection.

8.  **Return Result (Cache Miss)**: Finally, the system returns the structured JSON result, containing the **original Chinese input**, ASL Gloss, and video URL list, to the frontend.
    ```json
    // Example: Final result for Chinese input (Cache Miss, result parsed)
    {
      "jsonPayload": {
        "success": {
          "result": {
            "gloss": "I WANT BUY COFFEE",
            "original_input": "我想買咖啡",
            "videos": [
              [
                {
                  "gloss": "I",
                  "video_url": "https://storage.googleapis.com/genasl-video-files/I.mp4"
                }
              ],
              [
                {
                  "gloss": "WANT",
                  "video_url": "https://storage.googleapis.com/genasl-video-files/WANT.mp4"
                }
              ],
              [
                {
                  "gloss": "BUY",
                  "video_url": "https://storage.googleapis.com/genasl-video-files/BUY.mp4"
                }
              ],
              [
                {
                  "gloss": "COFFEE",
                  "video_url": "https://storage.googleapis.com/genasl-video-files/COFFEE.mp4"
                }
              ]
            ]
          }
        },
        "state": "SUCCEEDED"
      },
      "timestamp": "2025-03-29T18:00:50.004836399Z"
    }
    ```

#### Scenario 2: Cache Hit

When the system finds a matching record for the input text in the cache (regardless of the original language), the workflow is significantly simplified. We use the English input "I want buy coffee" as an example:

1.  **Receive Input**: The workflow receives the text input provided by the user.
    ```json
    // Example: English Input
    {
      "jsonPayload": {
        "start": {
          "argument": {
            "text": "I want buy coffee"
          }
        }
      },
      "timestamp": "2025-03-29T17:49:34.252173592Z"
    }
    ```

2.  **Cache Check (Hit)**: The system uses the original input text "I want buy coffee" to look up in the `sentence_cache` and successfully finds a record.
    ```json
    // Example: Cache Hit for English Input (Showing partial mapping)
    {
      "textPayload": {
        "fields": {
          "gloss_text": { "stringValue": "I WANT BUY COFFEE" },
          "video_mappings": {
            "arrayValue": {
              "values": [
                {
                  "mapValue": {
                    "fields": {
                      "gloss": { "stringValue": "I" },
                      "video_url": { "stringValue": "https://storage.googleapis.com/genasl-video-files/I.mp4" }
                    }
                  }
                },
                {
                  "mapValue": {
                    "fields": {
                      "gloss": { "stringValue": "WANT" },
                      "video_url": { "stringValue": "https://storage.googleapis.com/genasl-video-files/WANT.mp4" }
                    }
                  }
                }
                // ... subsequent mappings omitted ...
              ]
            }
          }
          // ... other fields omitted ...
        },
        "name": "projects/genasl/databases/(default)/documents/sentence_cache/I want buy coffee"
        // ... metadata like createTime, updateTime might be present ...
      },
      "timestamp": "2025-03-29T17:49:35.189564765Z"
    }
    ```

3.  **Skip Processing Steps**: Due to the cache hit, the system skips the language detection, intermediate translation, ASL Gloss conversion, and video URL mapping steps.

4.  **Return Result (Cache Hit)**: The system directly uses the Gloss and video URL list retrieved from the cache to prepare and return the final result. Note that `original_input` still reflects the original user input that triggered the cache hit ("I want buy coffee").
    ```json
    // Example: Generic Final Success Result (result parsed)
    {
      "jsonPayload": {
        "success": {
          "result": {
            "gloss": "I WANT BUY COFFEE",
            "original_input": "I want buy coffee",
            "videos": [
              [
                {
                  "gloss": "I",
                  "video_url": "https://storage.googleapis.com/genasl-video-files/I.mp4"
                }
              ],
              [
                {
                  "gloss": "WANT",
                  "video_url": "https://storage.googleapis.com/genasl-video-files/WANT.mp4"
                }
              ],
              [
                {
                  "gloss": "BUY",
                  "video_url": "https://storage.googleapis.com/genasl-video-files/BUY.mp4"
                }
              ],
              [
                {
                  "gloss": "COFFEE",
                  "video_url": "https://storage.googleapis.com/genasl-video-files/COFFEE.mp4"
                }
              ]
            ]
          }
        },
        "state": "SUCCEEDED"
      },
      "timestamp": "2025-03-29T17:49:35.822585487Z"
    }
    ```

This updated workflow more accurately reflects how the system handles different language inputs and how the caching mechanism optimizes performance.

## Conclusion

The GenAI-powered Global Sign Language Translator represents a significant step forward in making communication more accessible and inclusive. By leveraging cutting-edge AI technologies like Gemini 2.0 Flash and cloud-based architecture on Google Cloud Platform, we've created a solution that can bridge the gap between spoken/written language and sign language in real-time.

Our system not only demonstrates the practical application of generative AI for social good but also showcases how thoughtful architecture design can create efficient, scalable, and user-friendly solutions. The combination of AI-powered translation, video mapping, and performance optimization through caching enables a responsive experience that works across devices and languages.

As we continue to expand our ASL video dataset and refine our translation algorithms, the system will become even more accurate and comprehensive. Future enhancements may include support for additional sign languages beyond ASL, more sophisticated video generation techniques, and expanded educational features to help users learn sign language more effectively.

By making sign language more accessible to the general public, we hope to foster greater understanding and inclusion of the deaf community in everyday communication. This project demonstrates how technology can be harnessed not just for convenience, but for creating a more connected and inclusive world.
